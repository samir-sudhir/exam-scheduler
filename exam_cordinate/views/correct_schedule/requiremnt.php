Detailed Explanation of Requirements
8. Define Exam Slots, and Minimum Number of Days Between Two Exam Papers
Exam Slots Definition:

An exam slot is a fixed time period during which an exam can be scheduled for a specific course.

Exam slots are typically defined by both the time of day and the day of the week. For example, a slot might be for "8:00 - 9:30 AM on Monday", and there might be multiple such time slots each day.

You can define multiple slots per day, with varying start times throughout the day.

Here's a table illustrating how slots are distributed across days of the week:

Time Slot	Day 1 (Monday)	Day 2 (Tuesday)	Day 3 (Wednesday)	Day 4 (Thursday)	Day 5 (Friday)	Day 6 (Saturday)	Day 7 (Sunday)
8:00 - 09:30 AM	Slot 1	Slot 1	Slot 1	Slot 1	Slot 1	Slot 1	Slot 1
10:00 - 11:30 AM	Slot 2	Slot 2	Slot 2	Slot 2	Slot 2	Slot 2	Slot 2
12:00 - 1:30 PM	Slot 3	Slot 3	Slot 3	Slot 3	Slot 3	Slot 3	Slot 3
2:00 - 3:30 PM	Slot 4	Slot 4	Slot 4	Slot 4	Slot 4	Slot 4	Slot 4
4:00 - 5:30 PM	Slot 5	Slot 5	Slot 5	Slot 5	Slot 5	Slot 5	Slot 5
Explanation:

Slot 1 runs from 8:00 AM - 9:30 AM, which is available on Monday to Saturday.
The same time slots (e.g., Slot 1, Slot 2, etc.) are available every day, allowing for exams to be scheduled at the same times across different days.
Minimum Number of Days Between Two Exam Papers of a Student:

This defines how many days must pass between two exam papers scheduled for a student.
If a student is enrolled in multiple courses, the system must ensure that there is at least a minimum gap between their exam dates.
For example:
If the gap is 1 day, a student can have exams on consecutive days, such as Monday and Tuesday.
If the gap is 2 days, a student can have exams on Monday and Wednesday but not on Monday and Tuesday.
This rule ensures that students are not overloaded with exams on consecutive days, and it accommodates their preparation time.
9. Calculate an "Exam Schedule"
This requirement focuses on calculating a valid exam schedule, taking into account various constraints related to course scheduling, superintendents, and exam halls. Here's a detailed breakdown of each sub-requirement:

Overlapping Courses:

Definition of Overlapping Courses:
If two or more courses share the same group of students (i.e., the same students are enrolled in both courses), then those courses are overlapping and cannot be scheduled at the same time.
For instance, if a student is enrolled in CS401, CS403, and CS504, and all three courses are scheduled for exams, they cannot be scheduled in the same exam slot.
Scheduling Overlapping Courses:
The system must ensure that overlapping courses are assigned exam slots that respect the minimum days constraint. For example, if CS401 is scheduled on Tuesday, then CS403 and CS504 should not be scheduled before Thursday (based on a minimum gap of 2 days).
Action Required:
Identify the overlapping courses and ensure that their exam slots are spaced according to the defined minimum days.
Superintendent Eligibility:

Each exam should be invigilated by a qualified superintendent, but a superintendent cannot invigilate an exam for a course that they have taught.

If a superintendent has taught CS401, they cannot be assigned the invigilation duty for the CS401 exam, even if there is an available slot and they are free at that time.

Action Required:

The system must check which superintendents are eligible for invigilation duties based on the courses they have taught.
Fairness in Invigilation Duties:

To avoid overburdening any single superintendent, the number of invigilation tasks should be balanced as much as possible across all superintendents.

The difference between the maximum number of invigilation tasks and the minimum number of invigilation tasks assigned to any superintendent should not exceed 2.

For example:
If the minimum number of invigilation duties is 5, the superintendent with the most invigilation tasks should not have more than 7.
Action Required:

Distribute the invigilation tasks as fairly as possible, ensuring that no one invigilates significantly more exams than others.
Feasible Exam Halls:

Every exam must be assigned to a feasible exam hall, based on the number of students enrolled in the course.

A feasible exam hall is one that has enough seating capacity for all students enrolled in the course.

Preference should be given to the smallest feasible exam hall, so that larger halls are reserved for larger courses.

Example:

If CS301 has 140 students enrolled and there are five exam halls with the following capacities:
150, 180, 130, 100, and 200,
The CS301 exam should be assigned to the hall with a capacity of 150 (since it is the smallest hall that can accommodate all 140 students).
Action Required:

Identify the feasible exam halls based on student enrollment and assign the smallest available hall for each exam.
Summary of the Overall Process
Define Exam Slots: Set up time slots for each day of the week, determining when exams can be scheduled.
Minimum Days Between Exams: Define how many days must separate two exams for the same student.
Scheduling Exams: Ensure exams for overlapping courses are spaced properly, assign superintendents to invigilate exams they did not teach, distribute invigilation tasks fairly, and assign feasible exam halls based on student capacity and hall availability.






To determine whether your existing code can fulfill the requirements outlined for defining exam slots, calculating minimum days between exams, and scheduling exams with constraints, let's break down the core aspects and check each part:

1. Define Exam Slots:
Requirement: Exam slots should be defined by both the time of day and the day of the week, with multiple slots per day.
Can Your Code Fulfill This?
Your system should have a way to define the time of day and corresponding day slots. This could be done through a table structure that stores the timeslots for each day of the week (like in your table example), where each slot corresponds to a specific time and day (e.g., "8:00 - 9:30 AM on Monday").
If your code has functionality for storing and displaying these slots, then this requirement can be fulfilled.
Action: Ensure that there is a database table or similar structure to store these time slots and that your code allows multiple time slots per day.
2. Minimum Days Between Two Exam Papers:
Requirement: Define the gap between two exams for a student to prevent scheduling exams on consecutive days (or more, based on the defined gap).
Can Your Code Fulfill This?
You need logic to check for student enrollments and the dates of their scheduled exams to ensure that there is a minimum gap between each exam. This could be done by calculating the difference between the dates of two scheduled exams for the same student.
Action: Add logic that checks whether the gap between exams is sufficient for each student when scheduling exams.
3. Overlapping Courses:
Requirement: Courses that share students cannot be scheduled in the same time slot. If a student is enrolled in multiple courses, their exams must be spaced accordingly (based on the minimum gap).
Can Your Code Fulfill This?
If your code tracks which students are enrolled in which courses, it can check for overlaps in the scheduling of their exams and ensure that exams for overlapping courses are not scheduled on the same day or within a short time frame.
Action: Ensure that when an exam is scheduled, the system checks for overlapping student enrollments and avoids conflicts.
4. Superintendent Eligibility:
Requirement: A superintendent cannot invigilate an exam for a course they have taught.
Can Your Code Fulfill This?
You need to check whether a superintendent has taught a particular course before assigning them to invigilate that course's exam. This can be done by comparing the courses taught by the superintendent with the courses for which exams are being scheduled.
Action: Add a check to ensure that a superintendent is not assigned to invigilate a course they have taught.
5. Fairness in Invigilation Duties:
Requirement: Ensure fairness by balancing the invigilation duties across all superintendents so that no one invigilates significantly more exams than others.
Can Your Code Fulfill This?
You need to track the number of invigilation duties assigned to each superintendent and ensure that the maximum number does not exceed the minimum by more than 2.
Action: Implement a fair distribution mechanism that counts invigilation assignments and balances the workload as much as possible.
6. Feasible Exam Halls:
Requirement: Exams should be scheduled in halls that have enough capacity for the enrolled students. Preference should be given to the smallest hall that can accommodate all students.
Can Your Code Fulfill This?
Your code should track the seating capacities of each exam hall and assign a hall based on the number of students enrolled in the course. The smallest feasible hall should be assigned first.
Action: Ensure that when scheduling exams, the system checks the available halls and selects the smallest hall that can accommodate the students.
Summary of Actions Needed:
Exam Slots Definition: Ensure your database structure and code support the definition of multiple time slots per day.
Minimum Days Between Exams: Implement logic that ensures a gap between exams for students.
Overlapping Courses: Add checks for course conflicts based on student enrollments.
Superintendent Eligibility: Implement logic to ensure superintendents are not assigned to invigilate their own courses.
Fairness in Invigilation Duties: Add logic to balance invigilation duties fairly across all superintendents.
Feasible Exam Halls: Implement logic to check seating capacity and assign the smallest available hall for each exam.
If your code already includes the required functionality (database structure, logic to check conflicts, balance invigilation duties, etc.), then it can fulfill these requirements. If not, youâ€™ll need to add or modify your code to implement the necessary checks and logic.
